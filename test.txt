In programs that include scanners, the performance of the scanner frequently deter-
mines the performance of the entire program. Early versions of lex read from yyin one
character at a time. Since then, flex has developed a flexible (perhaps overly so) three-
level input system that allows programmers to customize it at each level to handle any
imaginable input structure.
In most cases, a flex scanner reads its input using stdio from a file or the standard input,
which can be the user console. There’s a subtle but important difference between read-
ing from a file and reading from the console—readahead. If the scanner is reading from
a file, it should read big chunks to be as fast as possible. But if it’s reading from the
console, the user is probably typing one line at a time and will expect the scanner to
process each line as soon as it’s typed. In this case, speed doesn’t matter, since a very
slow scanner is still a lot faster than a fast typist, so it reads one character at a time.
Fortunately, a flex scanner checks to see whether its input is from the terminal and
generally does the right thing automatically.
