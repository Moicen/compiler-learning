To handle its input, a flex scanner uses a structure known as a YY_BUFFER_STATE , which
describes a single input source. It contains a string buffer and a bunch of variables and
flags. Usually it contains a FILE* for the file it’s reading from, but it’s also possible to
create a YY_BUFFER_STATE not connected a file to scan a string already in memory.
